# Fundamentals First API (Spring Boot)

This project demonstrates backend fundamentals that remain constant across languages and frameworks:

- Correct HTTP status codes
- Explicit JSON request/response contracts
- Runtime polymorphism via interfaces
- Predictable error handling
- Explicit CORS configuration

It was built/refactored after a real technical interview reminded me
that fundamentals matter more than hype.

The same principles apply whether you build this in Java, FastAPI, or anything else.
